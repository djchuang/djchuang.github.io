<p>Ed.Note: this is an HTML page copied from open.djchuang.com, which runs on Google Sites. This site is powered by github pages. It's better for Markdown pages than HTML pages. It is supposed to be really fast. And it supports custom domains (or subdomains) too. The other thing to note is that github pages are public, unless you upgrade to have private pages. So all your website content is out in the open, so to speak. Just trying out another technology for content publishing. I think this one is great for developers, not for the non-techies.

<h2>Freely sharing knowledge and information for the good of humanity</h2>

<p>This is an assorted mix of articles, quotes, and texts that I've collected. Some collect baseball cards, some stamps. I collect information and knowledge. This web collection is being curated and preserved here to prevent link rot, obsolescence, and/or expiration of good content. See my personal website for the latest at <b><a href="http://www.djchuang.com/">djchuang.com</a>&nbsp;</b>
